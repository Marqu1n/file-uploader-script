# File Uploader Script
 A script in python that uploads a file of your choice.
 It uses the google drive api and requires a [Google Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects?hl=en_us) and the [Google Drive Api](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com).
 
 The paths on the script need to be adjusted for every computer you use, since every file needs the proper directory.

 The .bat file is used if you want to make an [automated version using Windows Scheduler](https://datatofish.com/python-script-windows-scheduler/#:~:text=Double%2Dclick%20on%20the%20Task,Python%20script%20daily%20at%206am.)
